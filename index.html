                <p>A camshaft is a rod which rotates and slides against a piece of machinery in order to turn rotational motion into linear motion. This change of motion is accomplished by the camshaft moving further and closer from the axis of rotation as the camshaft is pushed by the machinery. These moving pieces of the shaft are the cams.A camshaft on an internal combustion heat engine is a device that controls both the input of fuel and the expulsion of exhaust fumes. It consists of several radial cams, each displacing intake or exhaust valves. This camshaft is connected to the crankshaft via belt, chain or gears. This ensures consistent timing of the valves in relation to the motion of the pistons. The function of a camshaft is dependent on how a valve works and the function of the cam itself. A valve on a cylinder head consists of two basic parts, a stem and a head. The head plugs the nozzle that allows fuel intake or exhaust flow and requires linear motion. A cam, in its simplest definition, is a mechanical link that converts rotational motion into linear motion, or vice versa. The cams on a camshaft achieve this displacement by the rotation of a radial pattern, and a follower which moves perpendicular to the rotational axis. The cam pattern on a camshaft is non-circular with a single lobe. The follower matches the displacement of the cam as it rotates. This displacement is then translated to the stem of the valve, allowing head to rise as the lobes of the cam pass through the follower.</p>

                <h2>Maintenance</h2>
                <p>Many older engines required manual adjustment of the rockers or pushrods in order to maintain the correct valve lash as the valvetrain wears (in particular the valves and valve seats). However, most modern auto engines have hydraulic lifters which automatically compensate for wear, eliminating the need to adjust the valve lash at regular intervals.
                    Sliding friction between the surface of the cam and the cam follower which rides upon it can be considerable. In order to reduce wear at this point, the cam and follower are both surface hardened, and modern motor oils contain additives to reduce sliding friction. The lobes of the camshaft are usually slightly tapered and the faces of the valve lifters slightly domed, causing the lifters to rotate to distribute wear on the parts. The surfaces of the cam and follower are designed to "wear in" together, and therefore each follower should stay with its original cam lobe and never be moved to a different lobe. Some engines (particularly those with steep camshaft lobes) use roller tappets to reduce the sliding friction on the camshaft.
                    The bearings of camshafts, similar to those for the crankshaft, are plain bearings that are pressure-fed with oil. However, overhead camshaft bearings do not always have replaceable shells, in which case the whole cylinder head must be replaced if the bearings are faulty.</p>

        <p>The relationship between the camshaft and crankshaft is extremely vital for the integration of a car’s drivetrain and should definitely not be underestimated. They essentially start and end the engine cycle - from inlet stroke to exhaust stroke - keeping the different mechanical processes of each cycle in perfect harmony through their belted connection. They may seem just like machined billets of steel, but they form one of the most essential partnerships with a vehicle’s powertrain.</p>
